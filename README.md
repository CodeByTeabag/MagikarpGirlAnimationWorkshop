# MagikarpGirlAnimationWorkshop

## Goal

In this workshop you will have a better vision of how to use and set up a functional character animation system, creating and managing animation states, transitions and blend trees, and linking these animations to a Cinemachine state-driven camera that automatically changes angles based on the characterâ€™s current animation state.


## 1 Animation Setup ðŸ’ƒ
**Create and Configure Animator**
- Find an Idle animation clip in the ***Animations*** folder and change it's ***Rig Type*** from ```Generic``` to ```Humanoid```
- Enable ***Loop Time*** in the animation clip.
- Create a new ***Animator Controller*** in the ***Animator*** folder.
- Attach the Animator on the Player Prefab in the Inspector
- Add a ***Blend Tree*** state for the Idle animation.
- Open the Blend Tree and change the ***Blend Type*** to ```2D Freeform Directional```
- Create two float parameters called: ```VelocityX``` and ```MoveY``` and change both *'Blend'* parameters in the Inspector.
- Add a Motion Field.
- Choose the Idle animation clip and assign it to the Motion Field.
- Leave the PosX and PosY on ```0```.
- Run the game. *(Your character should play the Idle animation)*
- Make sure ***Loop Time*** is enabled for the Idle animation clip.
- Disable ***'Apply Root Motion'*** on the Animator in the Inspector.

***But whyyyyy?***

**Blend Tree and Movement**
Inside the Blend Tree:
- Add more motion fields for: 
1. Running Forward and set ```Pos X = 1``` and ```Pos Y = 0```
2. Running Backward and set ```Pos X = -1``` and ```Pos Y = 0```
3. Strafe Left and set ```Pos X = -1.5``` and ```Pos Y = 0```
4. Strafe Right and set ```Pos X = 1.5``` and ```Pos Y = 0```


**Add more Animation States**
- Add a new state called ```PushUp```.
- Assign the animation clip to that state.
- Create two transitions between Idle and Push Ups








Create a new layer.

Create an animation for the T-Pose (optional reference pose).

Create a transition between Idle and Push Ups.

Add a Boolean parameter (e.g., DoPushUps) to control when to perform push-ups.

Create a transition back to Idle when the Boolean is set to false.

Go to the Idle animation clip again and ensure Loop Time is enabled.



**Add a Layer**

- Create a new layer.
- Add an animation for the T-Pose (optional reference pose).



## 2 Cinemachine Component ðŸŽ¥

**Set Up State-Driven Camera** 
- Now that your animation state machine works, we will make the camera change angles based on it.
- For ease of use, weâ€™ll use a Composite Camera setup.


**Create a State-Driven Camera**
- Create a State-Driven Camera Object in your scene.
- Drag your character into the Animated Target field.
- The camera should now have access to the Animator States.
- Add several child cameras under the state-driven camera.
- Position these child cameras in different places so itâ€™s easy to see when the view changes.

**Link States to Cameras**
- In the State-Driven Camera settings, add rows to connect animator states to specific cameras.
- In each row, select a State and a Camera.
- Play the game and observe whether the camera angles switch smoothly based on animation states.

**Fine-Tune the Camera**
- Experiment with Default Blends in the main State-Driven Camera to control how transitions between cameras feel.
- Adjust blend times, easing, and field of view until the result feels natural and dynamic.

 **Result** âœ…
You now have a fully functioning animated character that transitions smoothly between animations, and a Cinemachine system that dynamically changes camera angles depending on those animation states â€” creating a polished, game-ready presentation.
